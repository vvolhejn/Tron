# Tron

A simple 4-player version of the classic game that I made in 2011.
We used to play a Flash version of Tron at school but it was limited to two players, so I made this Java version that supports four players.
It's simple but gets the job done.
I was surprised that the .jar I built over ten years ago still works for me. Good job there, Java!

One issue is that most keyboards can only detect a certain number of simultaneous key presses,
and with four people mashing keys at once, you hit this limit quite often.
That means that your keystrokes get ignored sometimes.
